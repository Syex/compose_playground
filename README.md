# Jetpack Compose playground

A simple playground repository connecting to the GitHub API, showing repositories of a user (default: mine) and upon
a click opens the detail view of a repository.

This repository was first implemented using good, old XML files with the aim to convert the layout
to Jetpack Compose.
